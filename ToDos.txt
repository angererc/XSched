ToDos:

------------
Model
	* Add different schedule methods (schedule-now, schedule-after, schedule-inline, maybe 'join')
------------
Preprocessor
	* make exceptions work
	* classes as objects (and static calls, static fields etc) (accessing a class field can be done with a global node because the fields are enough to distinguish them; we can assign this global object to a "this" in a static method on formals and actuals)
	* native methods and reflection
	* handle Activation methods specially
	* compute "more complex" relations (locks, ...)
------------
Wala
	* Heap Array SSA
	* Interval Analysis
	* "containment analysis" for finding bytecodes that are enclosed in a pair of "things" (monitor enter/exit, atomic region, ...)
------------
Points2 Analysis
	* add object sensitivity
	* add heap array stuff
------------
Schedule Analysis
	* make work with p2 analysis
	* work on "magic step"
	* work on flattening
------------
Optimizations
	* add 1 or 2 more optimizations
	* make compiler aware of optimizations (bytecode rewriting)
------------
Evaluation
	* Find good programs to evaluate
	* write transformers transforming Intervals, Threads, Fork/Join into Activations
	* Make it work with transactions and synchronize
