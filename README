XSched is a framework for eXplicit Scheduling in Java and a corresponding schedule analysis. A schedule analysis can answer the question whether two tasks may execute in parallel or if they are (always) ordered. This information can be used in optimizations of parallel programs.

A BDDBDDB-based prototype can be found in a different branch. This branch contains a re-write of the schedule analysis in Java. The plan is to integrate this analysis with the Wala framework as well as a JIT-version in the Jikes RVM.
